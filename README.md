- 👋 Hi, I’m @zMantleS
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, maths, physics. music, art and many other things. I am hoping to get a good grasp of all of these when I finish my degree of Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming, maths, physics, then to develop an interesting physics based simulator system. Everything is a system, it's just a lot of words.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on better ways on solving any of my problems. I am eager but I am keen to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me isn't available yet, need to put discord at later date.
